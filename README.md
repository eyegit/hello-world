GitHub Tutorial Repository
This is about my life. I am trying to learn about Git, BitLocker, MKDocs, and Visual Studio.
I hope this works. I will be doing a lot of documentation so will ahve to see how can use the above 4 apps to produce quality documentation from which will be extracted web pages.
If all goes well the pages will be a hit and make it so much easier for us to find information within the GDIT system re: Medicaid metric and payments.
